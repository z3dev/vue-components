/**
 * This is Part 0 of working with JSCAD designs.
 * Why Part 0 (not 1)? Because JSCAD designs can be quite complex.
 * This is a very simple application, loading a JSCAD design from a static file (tutorial0.js),
 * which by the way is NOT JSCAD compliant.
 *
 * This tutorial loads the JSCAD design when the page loads. See script DESIGN above.
 * And therefore requires the JSCAD modeling library to be loaded beforehand. See script JSCAD LIBRARY above.
 * The sequence of scripts is VERY important.
 *
 * Finally, the design is executed (YUP! The design is actually JavaScript!), which produces some solids.
 * See EXECUTION below.
 *
 * This works but there are some issues.
 * - This tutorial requires a single file which contains a single design. JSCAD projects are not possible.
 * - This tutorial uses a non-JSCAD compliant design (See the notes inside tutorial0.js)
 * - This tutorial has a very specific sequence of scripts.
